# General Questions

1. Give a few ways other than eavesdropping (reading your messages) that an
   attacker can harm you.

2. Given the cipher below,
   decode the following message: `hqwthkygugygp`
   ```
   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz original
   cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab cipher
   ```

3. Use the two ciphers below in the repeating pattern
   `(cipher1, cipher1, cipher2)`
   to encrypt the following message : `grandvalley`.

   ```
   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz original
   cdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzab cipher1
   yzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx cipher2
   ```

   What information would I need in order to read your message?

4. If I put the above encryption scheme on my website and asked people to
   encrypt their messages to me using that scheme,
   why would that not be an effective way to keep your messages to me private?

5. The DES encryption scheme has a 56-bit key.
   How many more key options are there in AES with a 256-bit key?
   How much longer would it take to brute-force search all keys in 256-bit AES
   vs 56-bit DES?

6. Read the following comic
   (credit: [https://xkcd.com/936/](https://xkcd.com/936/)).
   There's really no question here; I just think everyone should read it.
   Discuss your thoughts on it with your fellow group members.
