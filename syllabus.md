The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](https://www.piazza.com/gvsu/winter2022/cis457/home).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

## Course Structure

The course will be run in a primarily "flipped classroom" style.
The majority of course material will be delivered via videos.
During the in-person sections,
* students will complete activities, generally in small groups
* students can ask questions about topics in the videos that they would like
  clarified or explained in a different way
* I will give alternative explanations for some of the more difficult topics

The decision to run the course this way is based on feedback from previous
students in my courses regarding their preferred delivery format.
Course feedback has indicated that students felt strongly that watching the
lecture videos aided in their learning and that activities were a better use
of class time.

Although moving to a flipped classroom was a common suggestion from my courses
in previous semesters,
this semester is my first instance of trying to run the course this way,
so there may be tweaks throughout the semester regarding exactly how things
are organized.
In particular,
**I reserve the right to make attendance part of the grading scheme and to
require short pre-lecture quizzes later in the semester if participation
in the in-person meetings is lacking.**
(I would notify you via Piazza if I were to make any changes of this sort,
and the changes would not apply retroactively.)

You are very unlikely to succeed in this course if you do not both watch the
lecture videos attentively and come to class and actively participate.

## Course Meetings

This course meets four times per week:
* 11 - 11:50 AM Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (MAK D-1-117)
* 3 - 4:50 PM Tuesdays (MAK A-1-167)

## Sickness Policies

If you are sick,
please do not come to class, lab, or office hours.
Let me know,
and we will figure out a way for you to make up any missed work.
Although missing class frequently is not a good idea,
as long as you follow the lecture videos and complete the posted activities,
missing a few times should not severly hamper your learning.

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Explain layered communication protocol architecture
* Describe the operation of various routing protocols
* Compare reliable and an unreliable data transfer protocols
* Develop distributed network application using the Sockets interface
* Apply various security measures in networks

## Course Policies

* All assignments must be submitted to Prairielearn and are due at 11:59 PM EST
  on the due date.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
  I reserve the right to specify alternate submission cutoffs per assignment.
* No late assignments will be accepted.
  However, to account for cases where a student sleeps through a deadline,
  forgets their laptop at work and cannot make the submission deadline, etc.,
  assignments may be turned in up to 2 hours after the deadline for up to 75%
  credit and up to 12 hours after the deadline for up to 50% credit.
  This is intentionally a steep penalty --
  a student would almost certainly be better off turning in whatever work was
  completed before the deadline rather than taking the additional hours as time
  to work.
  Please be sure to plan ahead,
  and do not wait until the last minute to submit and risk a large penalty.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Homework assignments and projects are to be completed individually unless
  directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Labs are to be completed in pairs.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth
by Grand Valley State University.
In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic
honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems,
the details of which can be found at
[http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/).
Note that for paired or group assignments,
it is expected that every member of the group contributes work toward the final
product,
and each group member is responsible for the work turned in by the group as a
whole.

Plagiarism is not tolerated and will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment
in question.
(Code or ideas taken from another source must be cited.)
Violations will be reported to [OSCCR](https://www.gvsu.edu/osccr/)
and handled per university policy.

## Inclusion and Equity

As an instructor,
I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our
class.
To that end,
please reach out to me if there is anything in my behavior or in the classroom
environment that makes you feel unwelcome or unvalued.
I will seek to keep any information you share with me in this regard
confidential to the extent that it is legally possible to do so.

## Special Assistance

If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of
learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616.331.2490.
