The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](https://www.piazza.com/gvsu/winter2022/cis457/home).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

## Course Structure

The course will be run in a primarily "flipped classroom" style.
The majority of course material will be delivered via videos.
During the in-person sections,
* students will complete activities, generally in small groups
* students can ask questions about topics in the videos that they would like
  clarified or explained in a different way
* I will give alternative explanations for some of the more difficult topics

The decision to run the course this way is based on feedback from previous
students in my courses regarding their preferred delivery format.
Course feedback has indicated that students felt strongly that watching the
lecture videos aided in their learning and that activities were a better use
of class time.

Although moving to a flipped classroom was a common suggestion from my courses
in previous semesters,
this semester is my first instance of trying to run the course this way,
so there may be tweaks throughout the semester regarding exactly how things
are organized.
In particular,
**I reserve the right to make attendance part of the grading scheme and to
require short pre-lecture quizzes later in the semester if participation
in the in-person meetings is lacking.**
(I would notify you via Piazza if I were to make any changes of this sort,
and the changes would not apply retroactively.)

You are very unlikely to succeed in this course if you do not both watch the
lecture videos attentively and come to class and actively participate.

## Course Meetings

This course meets three times per week:
* 11 - 11:50 AM Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (MAK D-1-117)

There is a lab once per week:
* 3 - 4:50 PM Tuesdays (MAK A-1-167)

## Sickness Policies

If you are sick,
please do not come to class, lab, or office hours.
Let me know,
and we will figure out a way for you to make up any missed work.
Although missing class frequently is not a good idea,
as long as you follow the lecture videos and complete the posted activities,
missing a few times should not severly hamper your learning.

## Course Objectives

After successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
* Explain layered communication protocol architecture
* Describe the operation of various routing protocols
* Compare reliable and an unreliable data transfer protocols
* Develop distributed network application using the Sockets interface
* Apply various security measures in networks

The grading for homework and labs in this course will done somewhat differently
from what you may be used to.
Essentially, you keep working on these until you get the correct answer,
but no partial credit is given.
Instead, I will provide you with helpful feedback about any errors in your
submission and allow you to resubmit without penalty but at a limited rate.
More details about how this works are given below.

This grading scheme is based on the ideas of "mastery grading,"
which you may have seen in various forms in other CS and Math classes.
The benefits to you are that
(1) you have the opportunity to keep trying until you learn the material, and
(2) your grade is likely to be higher than it would be in a standard scheme
if you are willing to put in the work.
The drawback to you is that you cannot coast by a difficult topic on partial
credit --
you need to keep going until you can demonstrate that you understand.
Mastery schemes tend to push up the grades of students who often get C+s or
higher,
but they can also result in more failing grades,
so be sure to stay on top of the work in this course.

Grading for projects and exams will follow the more standard "one-and-done"
scheme where you submit once and receive a grade based on how well your
work meets the specifications.
This is simply because I currently do not have a better way of grading these
that can be done in a reasonable amount of time.

### Homework grading

First, it is important to note that
**all homework scores are either 100% or 0%**.
If you answer five out of six questions correctly,
your score is still 0% until you resubmit and get all questions correct.

In homework assignments,
some of the questions will be automatically graded.
In those cases,
you may attempt the problem as many times as needed until you earn full credit
for that problem.
For the other questions,
you complete them all and submit the assignment as a whole when you are ready
for it to be graded by me.
At that point,
I will either score the homework at 100% complete or give you feedback about
mistakes that you made.
If you do not score 100%,
you will be allowed to resubmit as described below.

You may *not* turn in a partial assignment to get feedback on just the part
that you have finished so far.
If any of the questions are skipped, answered with "I don't know,"
or if I determine that any provided answer does not represent a good-faith
effort to solve the problem,
then I will not give feedback on any part of the assignment.
Along the same lines,
you may *not* submit an assignment unless all automatically-graded parts have
been completed for full credit.

To submit an assignment or request regrading of an updated assignment,
simply upload your newest answers to Prairielearn and add an `X` to the
relevant place in the
["grade me" spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FF58ERCKb0UBHvipfZFfY2RrHKgqX_KO0SnPn22OZLI/edit?usp=sharing).
I will check this spreadsheet at the end of every week,
grade as requested,
and clear it for the upcoming week.

A key point to bear in mind is that
**you are limited to two homework assignment submissions per week.**
For example, if you need to redo some questions on HW1,
you can resubmit HW1 in the same week in which you submit HW2.
But, you cannot resubmit HW1 and resubmit HW2 in the same week in which you
submit HW3.
A week starts at 12:00 AM Monday morning and ends at 11:59 PM Sunday night.

### Lab grading

The lab grading will be done in the same way as the homework grading except
that most of the labs will not have any autograded portion.
Similar to homework,
you are allowed up to two lab submissions in a given week.
These are different from your homework submissions:
e.g., you may submit HW1, HW2, Lab 1, and Lab 2 all in the same week.

## Important Dates

Deadline to drop with a "W" grade: March 11, 2022, by 5 pm.

Midterm Exam: Tuesday, March 1

Final Exam: TBD

## Course Policies

* All gradable work (homework, projects, etc.) must be submitted to Prairielearn.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
* All projects are due at 11:59 PM EST on the due date.
* No late projects will be accepted.
  However, to account for cases where a student sleeps through a deadline,
  forgets their laptop at work and cannot make the submission deadline, etc.,
  assignments may be turned in up to 2 hours after the deadline for up to 75%
  credit and up to 12 hours after the deadline for up to 50% credit.
  This is intentionally a steep penalty --
  a student would almost certainly be better off turning in whatever work was
  completed before the deadline rather than taking the additional hours as time
  to work.
  Please be sure to plan ahead,
  and do not wait until the last minute to submit and risk a large penalty.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Homework assignments and projects are to be completed individually unless
  directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Labs are to be completed in pairs.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Academic Honesty

All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards set forth
by Grand Valley State University.
In addition, students in this course are expected to adhere to the academic
honesty guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems,
the details of which can be found at
[http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/](http://www.cis.gvsu.edu/Academics/Honesty/).
Note that for paired or group assignments,
it is expected that every member of the group contributes work toward the final
product,
and each group member is responsible for the work turned in by the group as a
whole.

Plagiarism is not tolerated and will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment
in question.
(Code or ideas taken from another source must be cited.)
Violations will be reported to [OSCCR](https://www.gvsu.edu/osccr/)
and handled per university policy.

## Inclusion and Equity

As an instructor,
I will strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning environment in our
class.
To that end,
please reach out to me if there is anything in my behavior or in the classroom
environment that makes you feel unwelcome or unvalued.
I will seek to keep any information you share with me in this regard
confidential to the extent that it is legally possible to do so.

## Special Assistance

If there is any student in this class who has special needs because of
learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616.331.2490.
